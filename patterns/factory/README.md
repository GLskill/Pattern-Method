# The Factory Method

#### The Factory Method is a creational design pattern. It provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This flexibility allows for dynamic object creation based on different contexts or situations.

Here are some key characteristics of the Factory Method:

Defines an interface for creating objects: This interface establishes the steps involved in object creation, ensuring consistency and reusability.
Delegates object creation to subclasses: Subclasses can override the factory method to specify the concrete class of object to be created, allowing for customization based on specific needs.
Promotes loose coupling: By decoupling the creation of objects from their usage, the Factory Method reduces dependencies and improves code maintainability.
Here are some common applications of the Factory Method:

Creating different types of products: A food ordering system might use a Factory Method to create different types of pizza based on the chosen toppings.
Generating documents: A document management system might use a Factory Method to create different types of documents (resumes, reports, etc.) based on user selection.
Simulating different character types: A video game might use a Factory Method to create different types of enemies or NPCs based on the game level or player location.
