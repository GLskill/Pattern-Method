# This project was created to consider all OOP programming patterns

What are design patterns in OOP?

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), design patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. They provide a blueprint for structuring your code, making it more flexible, maintainable, and understandable. These patterns don't dictate specific implementations, but rather act as guiding principles and best practices.

Here are some key characteristics of design patterns:

Reusable: They can be applied to different situations and problems with minor modifications.
Loosely coupled: They promote loose coupling between different parts of your code, making it easier to maintain and modify.
Modular: They break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable pieces.
Proven: They have been tested and used by other developers, saving you time and effort.
There are many different design patterns, each with its own purpose and benefits. Here are some of the most common ones:

Creational patterns: These patterns deal with object creation in a flexible and efficient way. Examples include:

Singleton: Ensures that only one instance of a class exists.
Factory Method: Creates objects without exposing the specific class to be created.
Builder: Separates object construction from its representation.
Structural patterns: These patterns address the way objects and classes are composed and relate to each other. Examples include:

Adapter: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
Decorator: Adds new functionality to an existing object dynamically.
Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
Behavioral patterns: These patterns define how objects communicate and interact with each other. Examples include:

Observer: Allows multiple objects to subscribe to and react to changes in another object.
Strategy: Allows changing the behavior of an algorithm at runtime.
Template Method: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.
By understanding and using design patterns, you can significantly improve the quality and maintainability of your object-oriented code. Learning these patterns can also help you communicate more effectively with other developers and understand existing codebases better.
